147063136,19693,https://api.github.com/repos/twbs/bootstrap/issues/19693,patrickhlauke,6,0,0,0,0,7,a series of hopefully non-controversial tweaks to some common color contrast issues that v inherited from v.some of these tweaks aim for the full color contrast ratio recommended by wcag while others notably the success info and warning tweaks go for the slightly more relaxed which is really for large text so still not ideal in all situations...but a slightly more achievable goal particularly for vibrant colors).not all possible combinations have been tried out but most tweaks seem to move towards a more positive result judging purely by the documentation examples
147033930,19692,https://api.github.com/repos/twbs/bootstrap/issues/19692,719media,3,0,0,0,0,0,"ok here is my first go at it.i have not done any documentation since its too early but here are the main points/areas of discussion i got rid of dropdown-margin-top so as to use the offset to more correctly position the dropdown useful for when the dropdown can reposition based on viewport size since the dropdown-menu now gets moved out of being a child of dropdown it faciliated the need for some minor css changes most notably open dropdown-menu needed to be changed since dropdown-menu was no longer a child of dropdown this means that the open class is actually used in two separate elements now the dropdown and the dropdown-menu this seems a little wierd to me but i dont know how else to do it we could technically probably get rid of the open on the dropdown element but i left it intact for now partially because there are unit tests around it but also because there is a css class dealing with getting rid of an outline on focus on the dropdown if the dropdown-toggle is an a tag instead of just using position and a map like the toolip.js does i just exposed the entire attachment/targetattachment variables i felt that more flexibility was better centering a dropdown on the target etc than creating a simplified map otherwise we could create a map with the four most common bottom-left bottom-right top-left top-right i still left dropdown as available to just instantiate by use of a class vs having to instantiate like tooltip with javascript this could be changed but i was not sure what kind of discussions have happened around that etc context.menu is available so that the dropdown-menu object can always be referenced from the dropdown context no matter where it may move in the dom this is necessary so that the menu can be found again after it has moved in the dom i think perhaps its worth adding data-target like the modal so that this can be explicitly set if desired i defaulted the constraints to have the dropdown shift into viewport always but maybe this is not desired to be default i think normally when the dropdown goes out of viewport horizontally users would almost always want/expect this however the dropup behavior for when it goes out of viewport vertically may not be desired as default i cleaned out a couple classes but there are still some dropup and navbar-fixed-bottom styles that can probably be removed throughout the scssthis is my first time using some of the bootstrap build tools grunt ruby etc so my apologies if i did anything wacky.new options: attachment top left,targetattachment bottom left,offset constraints to window attachment together pin true"

102004800,17070,https://api.github.com/repos/twbs/bootstrap/issues/17070,Jakobud,3,0,0,1,0,0,for readability reasons i would consider using a px-to-rem mixin instead of hard coding rems everywhere the reason for this is simply because people can more easily recognize what pixel sizes are compared to rem s and em s.for example everyone knows that a ipad width is px of people arent going to know what that is in em/rem but when i look in the v source and i see the the grid sizes for tablet at em im like uhhh okay so how wide is that really lets see here assuming px base font size oh that means px okay.its pretty easy in sass to do a mixin to convert px-to-rem: h font-size rem px value that will be converted to rem} its very readable any developer can look and see that the value is px but that sass is going to convert the final value to rem again its easy for developers to visualize what px is its not easy for developers to visualize what rem looks like...also here is proof from the v source itself that this should be considered are feeling the need to add comments to help people understand how big those rem s are would be a lot more simple to just do: $container-max-widths sm rem md rem lg rem xl rem default; its more readable and results in the same rem values in the end.so in short keep everything in rems in the end product yes but use pixels to get there because its easier to visualize and more familiar to developers use sass mixins to your advantage here.i would be more than willing to help in this transition if the idea is accepted
