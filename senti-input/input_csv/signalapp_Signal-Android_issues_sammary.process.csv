348407956,"dear developers,after an update to signal version on android some beautiful colors like orange for contacts disapeared and now i can choose from only nine colors i can hardly distinguish because i am suffering of deuteranopia it would be great if you can reenable more colors to choose from.another problem is that my wired headset on my sony li is still muted only with signal maybe due to echo cancelation"

340764357,the first large batch of changes to improve signals look.the most interesting java change is likely conversationitem which renders the message items theres a lot of work there around new rendering rules that take into consideration neighboring messages to collapse footers round corners show/hide the author etc.its also worth noting that because the position of the timestamp information changes based on message type solo-images and shared contacts render the timestamp in a different location the footer has been broken out to conversationitemfooter so it can be re-used in different areas.also because the way we show images has changed a bit ive wrapped thumbnailview into a class conversationitemthumbnail so we can render the conversationitemfooter and timestamp background shade without making thumbnailview overly-specific. test devices moto e nd gen android api galaxy s mini android api google pixel android api

314289000,signal has been subverted warning do not use it anymore it is not secure is forcing an update in order to continue to use it even the apk version will stop working until end user is forced to update to the newest version of signal problem is newest version of signal has gotten rid of the passphrase in favor of forcing everyone to use a fingerprint for the screenlock now no one is able to set their own passwords anymore why this change stranger still there is now suddenly a mysterious retroactive flip-flop akin to the mandela effect whereby now the developer of signal wants us all to believe that it has always been the case that signal never offered true end to end encryption at rest and that the passphrase for the signal app was never anything more than a useless screenlock when other users pointed out the blatant inconsistency in this regard the developer promptly closed and then locked the topic/issue at hand however recall that not long ago signal was praised by many as the only im app that offers true end to end encryption at rest quote the intercept article/review of signal app in relevant part:finally online backups are a gaping hole in the security of whatsapp messages end-to-end encryption only refers to how messages are encrypted when theyre sent over the internet not while theyre stored on your phone once messages are on your phone they rely on your phones built-in encryption to keep them safe which is why its important to use a strong passcode if you choose to back up your phone to the cloud such as to your google account if youre an android user or your icloud account if youre an iphone user then youre handing the content of your messages to your backup service provider.by default whatsapp stores its messages in a way that allows them to be backed up to the cloud by ios or android.if you back up your phone to your google or icloud account signal doesnt include any of your messages in this backup whatsapps gaping backup issue simply doesnt exist with signal and theres no risk of accidentally handing over your private messages to any third-party company.stranger still there is now suddenly a mysterious retroactive flip-flop akin to the mandela effect whereby now the developer of signal wants us all to believe that it has always been the case that signal never offered true end to end encryption at rest and that the passphrase for the signal app was never anything more than a useless screenlock when other users pointed out the blatant inconsistency in this regard the developer promptly closed and then locked the topic/issue at hand before the change we had this official faq->in relevant part:the first time you run signal it will ask you to create a passphrase this passphrase will be used to encrypt all of signals secret information including the keys used to encrypt your text messages the security of your messages depends on the strength of this passphrase so make it good signal can be configured to cache this passphrase in memory for as long as its running or for a specific length of time so you wont need to be constantly re-entering it in order to access or send messages this passphrase cannot be recovered if it is lost.andall text messages are encrypted with your passphrase before being stored this encryption includes the bodies of the text messages themselves under the secure storage section....now after the change fingerprints will be forced to be used for all security in place of the passphrase they have entirely removed the ability to set a custom password or even to use a custom passphrase that is independent of the underlining phone os security credentials i refuse to believe the developer of signal is not aware of the fact that using fingerprints as opposed to passwords gives up the constitutional rights and the fifth amendment rights say boycott signal i say signal has been subverted to the dark side i say signal is cia i call bs

310611823,its time for some spring cleaningas more people join the signal team and our android development efforts continue to accelerate it is increasingly important to organize incoming issues we rely on high-quality bug reports in order to triage prioritize diagnose and fix the problems that users discover were excited about the enhancements that have been added to signal recently and we want that momentum to continue.however the sheer volume of legacy issues combined with submissions that completely ignore the provided issue template has created a situation where there are currently more than open tickets most of these issues have been inactive for several years and they reference versions of signal that are no longer available many open issues are essentially ad-hoc discussion threads or feature requests that are a better fit for the community forum perhaps most importantly many of these issues lack debug logs descriptions and the steps that would be necessary to understand and reproduce the reported behavior a new beginningwe need to get to a point where we can effectively track actual issues in the github repository were aware of the features that users want and were working hard on them every day community involvement plays a large role in our development and planning process and we closely follow the forums and other feedback channels.we are taking the following steps in order to turn this repository into a functional issue tracker for bug reports the issue template has been updated to indicate that github issues should only be used to track existing bugs in signal if you feel like you are unable to make an idea fit within the confines of the template that might be a sign that you are about to submit something that isnt a bug if you disagree with the way that a feature is working but its working thats not a bug if you have a suggestion for a new feature thats also not a bug the community forum is available for all non-bug submissions and discussions this feedback is highly valuable but our github issue tracker is not the right venue for questions comments or feature requests we will routinely close issues that ignore or delete the issue template legacy issues that are more than one month old will be closed by an automated process as part of this cleanup effort out with the old in with the new and improvedusers are welcome to re-submit bug reports that follow the updated issue template and that still affect the current release of signal by re-submitting valid issues with up-to-date reproduction steps and debug logs that were produced by a recent version of signal the developers will be better equipped to solve any underlying problems please include the legacy issue id in your new submission if there is important context available in the old thread.we need the community to help us with this step and we sincerely appreciate your participation in this cleanup effort.many of you have been asking for this for a long time we believe that these actions will improve the development cycle and make the process easier to follow for everyone involved we apologize in advance for the flood of email notifications but the pain is temporary and a brighter future awaits

304205953,this may be flogging a dead horse moxie himself closed several of these issues with what i suspect was a growing sense of aggravation i once again request that signal be added to f-droid.i also feel reopening the dialogue a year later has real value moxie is correct in stating that a download from play is easier than the harrowing process of enabling third party repos in android this request is for more security minded users and establishes a post google path forward moxie outlined a very reasonable list of requests for f-droid and his sentiments on the security of the platform were well founded f-droid now allows to distribute a developer-signed version of the app if the build is reproducable by their build server and f-droid now allows installation of apps without enabling third-party support fdroid allows opt-in bug reporting f-droid receives annual security audits from neutral partners and publishes the results moxie was kind enough to provide in but as the danger zone implies this is textbook sub-optimal distribution no better than google play why we need signal in fdroid google has been a member of the prism program for years the fact that it joined the program at all is more than enough reason to reassess it as the sole provider of signal arab spring events have proven the big google facebook twitter all go predictably dark by relying solely on google signal cannot be quickly deployed in such emergencies where it would do the most good

204466637,signal is great for sending encrypted messages and having encrypted voice calls with other signal users but pretty bad for sms/mms on android here are a few anecdotes i have never had mms just work in signal for android or in textsecure before it someone sends a group message or tries to text a photo and signal wont let me see what it is ive fixed it before but the easiest solution is stop making signal the default sms/mms app and use another app for it i recently convinced all of my immediate family to use signal and created a family signal group its great and they all loved it right away but then my sister got really frustrated because she wasnt able to send a big group message to a bunch of people many of whom werent using signal due to weird mms bugs in signal for android it would have been much better for her to use her old sms/mms app for that message and signal for signal messages my partner is a student and she asked some of her classmates to install signal to discuss study group stuff she told me that one of her friends installed it at first but it totally broke all of his mms groups so he uninstalled it so he could keep talking to his friends a cypherpunk friend of mine who is a hacker and a computer programmer has an mms group where his friends organize a dungeons and dragons game since hes been using signal for sms/mms he hasnt been able to read any of these messages while hes connected to wifi for some reason it works when hes not on wifi so now he has less adventure in his life.i think signal for android would be a better app if it just gave up on being an sms/mms app and were more like signal for ios or at least sms/mms support should be discouraged where advanced users can enable it in their settings if theyre comfortable troubleshooting android issues
203691958,"hi,im new to signal love how easy it is to use but i did find a few material design related issues that cause twitching of the eyes and other ocd-y things pretty much all of it has to do with alignment of elements spacing between them etc.i realize that i may sound like im an a hole but a english it not my native tongue so finding the right words is sometimes difficult and b i actually care and think these issues shouldnt be too hard to fix and it really does make sense to adhere to androids design specs if only for consistency between apps.anyway on to the issues at hand.i used the app keyline pushing available in play store to overlay material design grids and from the looks of it i think signal uses a metric grid system instead of x.see this page for basic material design metrics and keylines conversations overview the app title in the action-/appbar should be at px from left edge weirdly in other screens it is horizontal spacing from edge to content is not px or px on tablets avatars are not x im guessing the list items are not px in height eitherhere are the specs for lists is a screenshot with keylines grid overlay and a rough sketch of how it should be layed out.! sig-conv-list settingsthe issues here are not super obvious until you draw a line from the title in the action-/appbar down and notice that the items in the content area dont match up with it this is also covered under the md components lists section conversationim guessing that the chat bubbles and avatar have to be looked at but my biggest gripe is the text input box at the bottom nothing seems to line up properly:! sig-message-box the send signal message placeholder texts vertical alignment is way off this is probably an easy fix just make it the same size as the normal text when a user inputs something because its a different size and does line up device info replace the examples with your info device motorola moto x nd gen android version signal version"

122683803,mobile phone plays notification sound for every message received when using desktop client which is annoying in e.g office environment.there should be an option to disable sounds while using desktop client.possible implementation:start a timer in the android app whenever a desktop client is used e.g message is read sent or so for say minute or configurable and during that timer dont play the notification sound if a message arrives while timer is active then keep a flag if the timer is reset by desktop interaction clear the flag otherwise play the notification sound after the timer expires.this way the phone is mute while the user is having a desktop conversation but there will be a notification in case when a message arrives from a remote party shortly after closing the desktop client or so

86746606,edit this pr now replaces the multiple individual resend buttons with a single one see screenshot and fixes i found that messagerecipientlistitem.java#l never gets executed because for group messages record.recipients only contains a recipient with name and number being unknown.with the proposed change basically the same as smsdatabase.java#l just without the call to phonenumberutils.formatnumber record.recipients contains a recipient with name some group name and number textsecure_group__!some_group_id .the resend button now only resends to the selected recipient.im not sure if theres some existing code relying on the current behaviour at least i found no problems when testing sending re-sending and receiving one-to-one and group messages with and without media

60545337,scenario i am member of a group and a message did not get through e.g because i have a bad network connection i then am presented with a message stating that i should tap for further details.after tapping i see a message detail dialog together with a list of all group members and separate send again buttons for every member.problem whenever i tap on one of those buttons the message is not only resent to this specific member but to the whole group to get rid of all buttons i would need to tap them all thereby causing the message to be sent multiple times to every person.i see that there might be cases in which some members have got the message while others have not in that case it would be good if the button would only cause a resend to this specific account.often it will be the case that none of the members got the message because the network issue is on the sender side in that case a send again to whole group button would be preferable
54442087,i noticed that in a conversation with several images or media files in general i have to click each one to view and then return to the conversation list to view the next.i think it would be more comfortable for the user to be able to swipe left/right between all media items sent in this conversation similar to the gallery app
53210663,what it says on the tin taken from discussion at the bottom of as samlanning mentioned and other users indicated the send method must currently be selected with every message with a chat partner stickiness would be helpful as long as the send button reflected it visually including for color-impaired users).implementing this would also be a workaround to itself

28351230,it would be good to know what attacks/threats were already considered in the current design and how they should be prevented additionally it would make sense to add those which were left out or are not considered at the moment.maybe this could be done in the context of a wiki page threat related issues uncategorized mastersecret implements parcelable secure improve privacy of contact discovery creating of group leaks name and included numbers to participants before any message is sent everyone who has my phone number can figure out that i use textsecure different certificates served to my home internet connection vs cell data fits in more categories ssl certificate problem protection against retroscope hyperlink previews being forced to do something quick way to wipe message database secondary password to erase all messages traffic analysis prevent traffic analysis feature request sending dummy short messages message security forwarded sms not being encrypted when not touching text reading encrypted messages without password enable sender to delete own messages from all parties in the conversation more elaborate than iv is zero on android application application locking optional lock adaptively block recurring password entries feature request lock textsecure upon connection to usb after crash wrong password allowed entry make disabling passphrase password protected login screen and last character of password visible in app switcher lock screen with pin entry not using flag_secure pr app does not prompt for password application storage security switch to page-level database encryption too few rounds of pbkdf when encrypting master key with password mastersecretutil salt size of bytes below nist recommended minimum of bytes improve storage encryption key iterations add possiblity to store key verification disable adb backups for security reasons application runtime security protection against retroscope reading secrets from ram denial of service potential dos android app not server vulnerability application hiding/obfuscation feature request ability to hide ts as another app apk/building/packaging/releases/download request google play signed download alternative check android sdk sha sum on dockerfile dependencies e g other libraries speex decoder is vulnerable authentication allow different kinds of identifiers for registration fingeprint exchange leak of personal identifyalbe information pii privacy anonymous bug reporting mechanism reveals personal info bug report leaks authentication secrets overall privacy-compromise created by profile feature possible leak of google account name via profile default content communicating/showing security related issues add service announcements feature request choice of security presets during setup ux security notification if plaintext message is received in encrypted conversation threat model document current security features and what attacks they should prevent create an overview about the attacks which should be prevented create security architecture diagrams introduce tests to ensure sourcecode always matches specification for security features
17365514,unfortunately i have noticed that you are violating on the conditions of free open source software you have forbidden to distribute textsecure binaries outside the google play store.all the arguments have you mentioned to justify this are invalid because this restriction contradicts to the freedom of the free software definition the freedom to redistribute copies of the software without asking permission also the gpl grants this you can do some research if you dont believe me.as a result you have two options to solve this issue release textsecure under a non-free proprietary license with all restrictions you want then you should delete this github repository or make it private or drop your restrictions that violate gpl and let textsecure be a real free software.you have the choice dont disappoint me
